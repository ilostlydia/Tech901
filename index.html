            <p> I work as a vet/kennel tech at an animal hospital currently. I do really well at reading dogs body language and changing the approach to do what we need to do. I am able to do this because of my attention to detail and problem solving skills. I would like to become a web developer because as much as I love working with animals it doesn't pay well and is pretty sad half of the time. I want a skill set that I can continually grow with the job market and tech.</br> What's your superpower?</p>
